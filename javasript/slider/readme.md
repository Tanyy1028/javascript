## 🖼️ Image Carousel

This is a simple **image carousel** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It displays a series of toy images with easy-to-use controls for navigation and autoplay. 🎠

### ✨ Features

* 🔜 **Next Button** – Shows the next image.
* 🔙 **Previous Button** – Shows the previous image.
* 🔁 **Autoplay Button** – Starts automatic image sliding every second.
* 🛑 **Stop Button** – Stops the autoplay.

### ⚙️ How It Works

* A list of image URLs is stored in an array.
* The `img` element updates dynamically based on the current index.
* Navigation buttons (`Next`, `Previous`) change the image manually.
* Autoplay is handled using `setInterval`, and stopped with `clearInterval`.

This project is great for learning how to build interactive UI components with vanilla JavaScript. 🚀
