# 🖼️ Image Carousel Project

This is a simple **Image Carousel** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to view a set of images with **Next**, **Previous**, **Autoplay**, and **Stop** functionalities. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- ▶️ **Next** button – View the next image.
- ◀️ **Previous** button – Go back to the previous image.
- 🔁 **Autoplay** – Automatically cycles through the images every 1 second.
- ⛔ **Stop** – Stops the autoplay.

## 🧠 How it Works

- Images are stored in an array (`arrImg`).
- The current image is displayed using the `<img>` element with the ID `img`.
- JavaScript changes the `src` of the image element based on the index.
- Autoplay is achieved using `setInterval`, and it is stopped with `clearInterval`.
